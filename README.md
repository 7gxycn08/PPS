# PPS

PPS is a Proxy Scanner and Classifier which scans a list of proxy server ipaddress:port and splits them into three categories based on their responses.

1.Working.
2.Semi working or Slow.
3.Not Working.


## Installation

Currently the script is compiled as a windows executable only.
Just unzip the file into a folder of your choice.


## Usage
1.Place your `ip:port` addresses in `ProxyList.txt`
2.Run the script.
3.Working proxies will be saved in `Good.txt`
4.Semi working will be saved in `SemiSlow.txt`
5.Not working proxies will be saved in `NonWorking.txt`
